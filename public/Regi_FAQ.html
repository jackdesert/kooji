<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-4"></a>How do I register for an event? 
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Once you have created your profile, you can immediately begin to sign up for events that are using the new online REGI system. Follow these 2 steps: 
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Find an event on the <i><a class="URL" href="hbTrips.php">HB Trip Listings</a></i> page that you are interested in. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Click on the REGI link listed near the bottom of the listing. Usually REGI links are of the form <i>http://www.hbbostonamc.org/regi/xxx</i>. This link takes you to this event’s REGI page. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">
On the REGI page of the event you are interested in, you will find basic information about the event: name, description, a gear list, and specific questions, such as whether you have the listed gear, and your carpooling details. Enter the requested information and click <i>Sign Up For This Event</i>. Your registration status will be listed as <i>SUBMITTED</i> under your <i><a class="URL" href="myEvents.php">My Events</a></i> page until the leader approves you for the event. If you are Approved, your status under <i><a class="URL" href="myEvents.php">My Events</a></i> will be changed to <i>APPROVED</i> and you will receive an automated email noting the update.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-5"></a>An event is marked &ldquo;FULL&rdquo;. Can I still register?

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
OPEN: This event is currently accepting new registrations.
</li>

WAIT LIST: All the spots on the event are taken. However, you can still sign up to be on the wait list, and if someone else cancels out of the event you will be notified. 
</li>

FULL: All the spots on the event are taken. No more registrations are being accepted, not even for the wait list. 
</li>
<li>
CANCELLED: This event has been cancelled. 
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-6"></a>&ldquo;My Status&rdquo; is &ldquo;APPROVED&rdquo;. What does that mean?
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
<i>My Status</i> is short for <i>My Registration Status</i>. It tells whether you have been approved for that particular event. Here is what the different statuses mean:
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
SUBMITTED: You have registered for the event. Your approval for this event is pending. 
</li>
<li>
APPROVED: You made the list. You’re in. You’re going. You’ll have a great time.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-7"></a>When will I know if I have been approved for an event? 
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
You may receive an email or phone call from the event registrar to go over a few things like gear and previous experience. Then when she actually approves you, you will get an email that indicates your registration status has been updated to either "APPROVED" or "WAITLIST". You can view your registartion status for all your events under the <i>My Status </i>column on the <i><a class="URL" href="myEvents.php">My Events</a></i> page. 
</blockquote>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-8"></a>What do I do if I’m WAITLISTED? 
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
If a spot opens up on the event, the leader will contact you to offer you a spot. If you are taken off the waitlist, you will get an email that your registration status has been changed to “APPROVED”.

<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-10"></a>How do I get a ride or offer a ride? 
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
When you register for an event, the REGI system will ask whether you can offer others a ride or if you need a ride yourself. Once you are approved for the event, you will be able to see other participants’ carpooling information. Who is coming, where they are coming from, whether they are offering or requesting rides, and their email address. You can then email them and offer to carpool with them. 
</blockquote>
<div class="Paragraph">

</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
If you do now already have an &ldquo;Create New Event&rdquo; link at the top of your screen, you need to request privileges from the site admin. To do this, just go to <a class="URL" href="/profile">your profile</a>, click &ldquo;Edit Profile&rdquo;, and check the box that says &ldquo;I have completed leadership training&rdquo;.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-12"></a>Creating a REGI Page for a New Event 
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
To create a REGI page for a new event or trip, log in and click <i><a class="URL" href="eventAdmin.php">Create New Event</a></i> on the navigation bar at the upper right. You are now in the Event Admin screen, which is only available to leaders. Supply information about the trip. Most of the information you enter is publicly viewable by anyone. However, the <i>Confirmation Page</i> is only visible to approved participants after they sign up for the event. And <i>Participant Info</i> is only be visible to participants who have been approved for the event, so this section is ideal for such information as meeting place and time, directions to the trail head, etc. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">
The default “Event Status” when you create a trip is “OPEN”. This status means that, if users click on your registration link, they will be allowed to register. If you wish to defer the opening of registration, set event status to "PENDING", which prevents new registrations, and update it to “OPEN” later. “WAIT LIST” will allow registrants to register, just like “OPEN”, but lets them know that the trip is already full. All other statuses (“FULL”, “CLOSED”, “CANCELLED”) do not allow new registrations. <br/>
Applicants are automatically asked if they have the required gear, if they have questions or comments, and for their carpool details. You can also enter an Additional Event Question if you have another question you want to ask participants when they sign up.

Select the <i>Roster </i>tab from the left side of the screen (this tab is only visible to Leaders, CoLeaders, and Registrars for this trip.)

This email will include a link to the Roster page. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Here on the Roster page you will find a table of applicants to your trip. Screen the people with status <i>SUBMITTED</i>. As you screen registrants, you may change their status to: <i>APPROVED</i>, <i>WAIT LIST</i>, or <i>CANCELED</i>. IMPORTANT: You must click on “Update Sign Up Sheet” at the bottom of the page each time you want to make changes to participants’ enrollment status.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-18"></a>Other trip leader/coleader registration 
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
Fellow coleaders and registrars must sign up for the event just like all other participants. Once they have signed up, log in to the system and go to the <i>Roster</i> page for the event. Using the pull-down menus to the far right of each person’s entries, change their status by selecting either LEADER, COLEADER or REGISTRAR. Once you change the status of a participant, they will be sent an automated email notifying them of the change. Leaders, Coleaders and Registrars of this particular event all have access to this event’s <i>Admin</i> page.

</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
You can stop accepting applications by setting <i>Event Status</i> to <i>FULL</i> on the event’s <i>Admin </i>page. This will prevent future sign-ups. As noted above, setting the trip to “WAITLIST” will allow participants to register and for you to accept them if there are cancellations. Therefore, this will be the most common selection once a event fills since cancellations are not uncommon.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-21"></a>Export Roster
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
You can print all the participants’ information to take with you on the trip.

</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
REGI is currently hosted at http://hbbostonamc.org/regi. The application was originally developed in LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and HTML in 2010 by Dirk Koechner, a long time AMC Boston chapter member and outdoor enthusiast. Then in June 2011 <a class="URL" href="mailto:jackdesert556@gmail.com">Jack Desert</a> stepped up to add more features and improve the look and feel of the site. If you have suggestions on what would really make this site get up and dance, Jack would love to hear them.
